## DevOps practices like Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) automate the build, test, and deployment processes ##
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that outlines the stages involved in developing software, 
from planning to deployment and maintenance.  DevOps plays a crucial role in streamlining and optimizing the SDLC.  
By automating processes, fostering collaboration, and emphasizing continuous integration and continuous delivery, 
DevOps helps to accelerate the SDLC, improve software quality, and reduce costs.  
It bridges the gap between development and operations, ensuring that software is delivered smoothly and efficiently.  
DevOps practices like continuous testing and monitoring also contribute to a more robust and reliable SDLC.
