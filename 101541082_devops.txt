DevOps is a set of practices and tools that combines software development and IT operations. It's a cultural philosophy that encourages collaboration and automation to improve the speed and quality of software delivery. 
How DevOps works

DevOps teams work together to eliminate roadblocks and improve how they create, deploy, and monitor software. 
Automation
DevOps uses technology to automate processes that were previously manual and slow. 
Integration
